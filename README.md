# Querying Decentralized Knowledge _Research Channel_

The Querying Decentralized Knowledge (QDK) Research Channel provides a **platform for researchers**
in domains related to query execution over decentralized knowledge.
It allows researchers to **share recent developments**, **discuss open challenges**, and **announce research results** to a wider audience.

The target audience of this channel consists of other researchers in related domains,
but also the wider public that are interested in this field for non-research aims.

## üß© Format

Every two months, a one-hour long livestream is held
during which several research groups are invited to present their research.
Each group receives a time slot, and is free to decide how to fill it.
For example, some groups may want a single presenter to go in-depth into a single topic,
while other groups may want a more fast-paced overview of research by several presenters.

Presentations are meant to trigger and enable discussion, as opposed to be unidirectional.
As such, expect interruptions from other participants.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to watch

For people that want to follow the discussions without presenting,
they can follow the video feed that is livestreamed to our [YouTube channel]().
All recordings are kept available for future reference in this YouTube channel.

## ü§ù How to participate

For researchers that want to present something during an upcoming session,
please contact [Ruben Taelman](mailto:ruben.taelman@ugent.be).

## üìÖ Schedule

Sessions will be held every two months on the first Tuesday of the month at 9:30 (CEST).

The next session will take place on **June 4 2024 at 9:30 (CEST)**.

## üí° Topics

The following topics (but not limited to) are relevant for discussion within this research channel:

- Distributed and federated querying over Knowledge Graphs
- Efficient query processing
- Benchmarking query engines for Knowledge Graphs
- Query languages
- Developer Experience
